            Many health regions suffer from patient blood specimen testing backlogs
            impacting efficient patient care delivery. To address this problem, it is necessary
            to determine the extent of these backlogs and identify facilities where they occur.
            This will allow for the implementation of targeted initiatives and resource
            allocation in the future to improve blood testing efficiency.

            SPED is a database to record collection and results data of patient specimens at
            the various testing facilities of a medium-sized, rural health region with a
            population of approximately 50,000 people. The database will record data of an
            estimated yearly, 1000000 blood specimen collections at 5 test facilities and their
            subsequent results following specific test administration. Importantly, the date
            and time of both specimen collection and result report allows for the precise
            determination of a specimenâ€™s processing time. The database will also assist in
            determining which tests and/or facilities are contributing most to backlogs.
            Additionally, the database will allow for records of spoiled specimens, which will
            help identify facilities with poor test procedures.
